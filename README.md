## 👋 Hi, I'm Kateryna Andriiak

I am a Fullstack Development student at GoIT, focusing on building modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. 
Although I do not yet have commercial experience, I have completed multiple educational projects using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Node.js. 
I am continuously improving my skills and learning best development practices to grow into a reliable and efficient full-stack engineer.
